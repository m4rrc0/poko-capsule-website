## User Guide (draft)

### Requirements

- A Github account
- Optional: A static hosting provider account (Cloudflare Pages, Netlify, Vercel, ...)

### Installation

1. [Fork this repository](#forking-the-repository-on-github)
2. [Deploy to your static hosting provider](#deploying-to-your-static-hosting-provider)
3. [Create a Github App](#creating-the-github-app)
4. [Configure environment variables](#configure-environment-variables)

#### Forking the repository on Github

1. Go to https://github.com/m4rrc0/poko-capsule-website
2. Click on "Fork" (in the top right corner)

#### Deploying to your static hosting provider

This step depends on the static hosting provider you choose but generally involves:

- Creating an account
- Creating a new project connected to the forked repository you just created
- Edit your environment variables and project configuration

#### Creating the Github App

1. Go to https://github.com/settings/apps
2. Click on "New GitHub App" (in the top right corner)
3. Fill in the form according to the [Github app creation form](./docs/github-app-creation.md)

#### Configure environment variables

Environment variables are values specific to your project that allows you to tie this source code to your specific project instance and to the services you use.

The environment variables are set in the provider's dashboard.  
If you want to see the full list of possible environment variables, have a look at the `.env.template` file.  
But the main variable you care about are the following:

- `PUBLIC_KEYSTATIC_GITHUB_APP_SLUG`
- `KEYSTATIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_ID`
- `KEYSTATIC_GITHUB_CLIENT_SECRET`
- `PUBLIC_REPO`
- `KEYSTATIC_SECRET`

The first 3 are retrieved from the Github app creation form. (See above)  

The `PUBLIC_REPO` is the repository where your content is stored in the form `owner/repo-name`. This variable shouldn't be necessary on Netlify or Vercel but it is on Cloudflare Pages.

The `KEYSTATIC_SECRET` is a random 64 characters string that you can generate with this little helper app for example: https://keystatic-deploy-test.netlify.app/generate-keystatic-secret/  
(or with the `generate-secret` npm script if you know how to do this)

### A note about working locally

Advanced users might want to work on their project locally. It can have many advantages but is not recommended for non-developers.

Here are a few things you need to know when working locally.

- Github app creation: You can follow the [Keystatic documentation](https://keystatic.com/docs/github-mode) to create the Github app.
- Keystatic secret: You can generate it with the `generate-secret` npm script
- You need a `.env` file. Copy the `.env.template` file and fill in the variables.

Depending on the advancement of the project, you might sometimes find more technical documentation in the [m4rrc0/keystatic-deploy-test repository](
https://github.com/m4rrc0/keystatic-deploy-test/).

## üí∏ Money talk: disclosure and commitment

While poko is [open source](https://itsfoss.com/what-is-foss/) and free for personal use, its use is currently subject to a one-time fee for commercial or non-personal projects.

The open source movement is awesome and an example for so many disciplines and industries. We want to be part of it!  
At the same time, there is a tricky balance to be found between simply giving away the most precious thing we have (our time) for what we believe in and making a project viable on the long run. Many open source maintainers still struggle to find the time and ressources to work on their projects, as awesome as they are.

We hope that, with time, we will find that perfect balance. In the meantime, here are a few principles and commitments we try to work by:

- Be transparent about our financial situation and commitments
- Follow our mission and values above profit
- Trust our community to support the project in the best way they can
- Transfer part of our profit to the main open source projects we rely on
